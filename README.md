## Description

Still TBD, but the initial idea is to have a nice app to display all the items from *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* in a nice way. Items needed for the museum will displayed separately, showing the percentage completed of each section of the museum and overall completion. Display of other items is still under work.


## How to run

TBD

## Dataset

The dataset used for this website was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset).


## Learning outcomes (for me)

I have worked with web development before, but I want to use this project to learn TypeScript and test out some things I may not be familiar with.
